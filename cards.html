<div class="firstrow"> 
	<div class="cardone">
	<img src="anafenza.jpg">
	<p>Anafenza is the Khan for the Abzan clan. It is priced at $4.20 currently. Anafenza's ability works extremely well with the Outlast mechanic, as it gives free +1/+1 counters to other creatures. A 4/4 for 3 mana is extremely good, and it helps negate many Black/Blue colored decks.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardtwo">
	<img src="narset.jpg">
	<p>Narset is the Khan for the Jeskai clan. It is priced at $2.35 currently. Narset's ability works very well with the Prowess mechanic, as she can enable you to cast spells for free, which translates to free power for your creatures.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardthree">
	<img src="sidisi.jpg">
	<p>Sidisi is the Khan for the Sultai clan. It is priced at $3.79 currently. Sidisi's ability works very well with the Delve mechanic, as it places cards into your Graveyard, which you can then use to make your other spells cheaper. It also summons a good deal of 2/2 zombies with  it's other ability as well, which helps solve the Sultai problem of a low Creature base.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfour">
	<img src="zurgo.jpg">
	<p>Zurgo is the Khan for the Mardu clan. It is priced at $1.49 currently. Zurgo is an extremely offensive Creature, and is reliant around crushing face early on before the defending player can kill him. He can be killed out of combat with some Instants or Sorceries, but is Indestructible as long as he is attacking.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfive">
	<img src="surrakdragonclaw.jpg">
	<p>Surrak is the Khan for the Temur clan. It is priced at $2.09 currently. Surrak is a large Creature that helps out all of his other powerful Creatures. Since creatures with large Power can be blocked by those with a low Toughness, and no damage will be done to the player, giving Trample to them makes it easier to kill their opponent.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="second row"> 
	<div class="cardone">
	<img src="pearllakeancient.jpg">
	<p>Pearl Lake Ancient is priced at $1.55 currently. It is a large Creature, which is uncommon for Blue cards, but and it can lead to many combat tricks through having Flash and the ability to send it back to your Hand.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardtwo">
	<img src="emptythepits.jpg">
	<p> Empty the Pits is priced at $1.99 currently. It is an expensive Instant spell that works very well in the late game. If you have enough mana, it can summon many 2/2 zombie Creature Tokens, if you can exile enough creatures from your Graveyard.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardthree">
	<img src="seetheunrwitten.jpg">
	<p>See the Unwritten is priced at $2.29 currently. It is a moderately-costed Sorcery that uses the Ferocious mechanic to get a good deal of effectiveness. Being able to bring out multiple Creatures for a relatively low mana cost is quite nice.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfour">
	<img src="sarkhanthedragonspeaker.jpg">
	<p>Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker is priced at $22.89 currently. It is a very good Planeswalker(which acts like another player but on your team), and can deal consistent damage whilst being a threat. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfive">
	<img src="wingmateroc.jpg">
	<p>Wingmate Roc is priced at $13.69 currently. It is a powerful Creature that, when Raid is activated, it will summon another copy of itself. This leads to a powerful board state from seemingly nothing. </p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="thirdrow"> 
	<div class="cardone">
	<img src="hoodedhydra.jpg">
	<p> Hooded Hydra is priced at $1.65 currently. It is a Creature that benefits from the late game, where players have large amounts of mana that they can blow on the Creature. You get double value from spending that much mana as well, as it will replace itself with many 1/1 Snake Tokens. The morph ability also leads to saving mana, as for 5 mana you will get a 5/5 and 5 snakes, instead of 3 if you cast it normally.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardtwo">
	<img src="ashcloudphoenix.jpg">
	<p>Ashcloud Pheonix is priced at $5.85 currently. It is a Creature that will replace itself whenever it dies, coming back any time that it is killed when face-up, and dealing a good amount of damage each time. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardthree">
	<img src="cleverimpersonator.jpg">
	<p>Clever Impersonator is priced at $4.09 currently. It is a Creature that can enter the battlefield as a copy of any Permanent (Enchantment, Creature or Artifact), making it useful if your opponent has a strong card that you want.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfour">
	<img src="sorinsolemnvisitor.jpg">
	<p>Sorin, Solemn Visitor is priced at $24.09 currently. It is a Planeswalker that has utility with it's abilities, as it can work with hordes of Creatures, summon more creatures, and hinders your opponents Creatures.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="cardfive">
	<img src="uginsnexus.jpg">
	<p>Ugin's Nexus is priced at $1.49 currently. It is an Artifact that is very unique, and hard to utilize correctly. However, if used correctly, you can take another turn, which is a very powerful tool.</p>
